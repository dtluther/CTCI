## Notes

### Trees vs. Binary Trees
* **Binary tree**: each node has ***UP TO*** 2 children
    * if any node has more than 2 children, it's not a binary tree
* A "leaf" node is a node without children
* **Binary search tree**: binary tree in which all left descendants <= node < all right descendants
    * can also have left descendants < node <= all right descendants, but less common
    * under some definitions, there are no duplicates; in others duplicates can be on either side, as mentioned above
        * make sure to clarify this with the interviewer
